Project (weeks 9-13)
In weeks 9-13, you will do a project in groups of 3-4 students.

This year’s (2025) list of projects is available here.

There are three deadlines for the project:

Project selection deadline: Monday of Week 8 at 23:59.
Please prioritise three projects using this sheet.
Project synopsis deadline: Monday of Week 10 at 23:59.
The synopsis should be approximately half a page to one page in length, including a project title, motivation, background, milestones, and references. The plan must be realistic. The primary purpose of the synopsis is to ensure the project size is well-calibrated and concrete enough to start working from day one. The synopsis will not be used in the evaluation. The synopsis should be sent to your project supervisor and handed in as an assignment.
Final report deadline: Friday of Week 13 at 23:59.
The project must be handed in as an assignment.
Format
You are required to submit a written report. The report should be a maximum of 4 pages, plus references, using the provided template (TBA). The report should also include a link to your project's GitHub repository. Among the files in the repository should be a Jupyter notebook that ideally should recreate the main results of your report. If some of your data is confidential, then use some shareable data instead.
